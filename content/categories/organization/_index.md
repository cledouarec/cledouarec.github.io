Here, you’ll find articles on:
- how informal structures really work beyond org charts,
- communication flows, information silos, and power dynamics,
- decision-making in complex systems,
- alignment (and misalignment) between values, incentives, and behaviors,
- the impact of organizational design on people, products, and technology,
- concrete, real-world lessons from the field.

The goal: to offer a systemic and human-centered view of organizations,
focusing on how work actually happens rather than how it is supposed to,
far from rigid models and fashionable frameworks, and useful for managers,
tech leads, and anyone trying to improve how teams and organizations function.
