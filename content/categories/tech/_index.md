Here, you'll find articles on:
- software architecture and design decisions,
- development best practices,
- system quality, robustness, and observability,
- tools, frameworks, and technical environments,
- performance, scalability, and reliability,
- real-world lessons learned from actual projects.

The goal: to offer a clear, pragmatic, hands-on approach, far from short-lived
trends, and useful for engineers, tech leads, or anyone interested in the
technical side of software.
