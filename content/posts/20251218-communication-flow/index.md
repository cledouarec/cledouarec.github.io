Communication is one of the most critical drivers of project success and a key
contributor to well-being at work. Yet effective communication does not happen
by chance. It depends on deliberate structures, shared rules, and clear
mechanisms that shape how information circulates within an organization.

Before exploring different team structures, it is essential to clarify a few
foundational concepts. These notions help us understand how organizational
structures emerge and how, over time, they influence corporate culture. The
first and perhaps most fundamental of these concepts is communication flow.

Within an organization, informations do not move in a single direction. It
follows multiple, often overlapping paths:
- **Downward**, from leadership to teams
- **Upward**, from teams to leadership
- **Horizontal**, between peers or functions
- **Diagonal**, across levels and departments
- **Hub**, where communication is centralized through a person, role, or system
  that acts as a coordination point

In addition, each of these flows can be formal, embedded in defined processes
and hierarchies, or informal, emerging organically through day-to-day
interactions. Understanding how these flows operate, and where they break down,
is a prerequisite for designing effective teams and resilient organizations.

## Downward communication

![diagram representing downward communication flow](downward_communication.svg "Downward communication flow")

Commonly referred to as *top-down communication*, downward communication flows
from leadership to employees. It is primarily used to transmit strategic
direction, operational plans, policies, and expectations. This form of
communication plays a central role in establishing clarity, consistency, and
organizational alignment.

Managers rely on downward communication to translate vision into action, ensure
objectives are understood, and provide guidance on execution. When
well-structured, it helps reduce ambiguity and coordinate collective effort
across teams.

Downward communication can follow two distinct structural patterns, depending
on how information is disseminated through the hierarchy.

**Direct downward communication** occurs when a manager communicates the same
message directly to all individuals within their span of control. Information
flows from one person to many, without intermediaries. This approach is often
used when speed, clarity, or message consistency is critical.

**Indirect downward communication** follows the hierarchical chain of command.
A manager communicates with their direct reports, who then cascade the
information to their own teams. This model supports scalability and reinforces
managerial responsibility at each level, but it also introduces the risk of
message distortion as information passes through multiple layers.

> [!example] Examples of downward communication
> - Presenting annual or quarterly reports
> - Announcing company policies or organizational changes
> - Clarifying strategic objectives and priorities
> - Conducting training or onboarding sessions
> - Performing performance appraisals

Common communication channels:
- Email
- Memos and newsletters
- Phone or video calls
- In-person staff or all-hands meetings

> [!success] Benefits
> - Reinforces alignment around goals, priorities, and strategy
> - Facilitates delegation and coordination at scale

> [!error] Drawbacks
> - Feedback loops tend to be slow or incomplete
> - Often perceived as directive, which can reduce engagement or motivation if
>   overused

## Upward communication

![diagram representing upward communication flow](upward_communication.svg "Upward communication flow")

Also known as *bottom-up communication*, upward communication flows from
employees to leadership. It is crucial for transmitting feedback, insights,
concerns, and suggestions from teams to decision-makers. This flow complements
downward communication by helping leaders stay connected to on-the-ground
realities.

Upward communication empowers employees to contribute to strategy, improve
processes, and highlight operational challenges. When supported and structured
well, it fosters transparency, trust, and a sense of engagement.

**Direct upward communication** occurs when team members share feedback or
report directly to leadership without intermediaries. This is often effective
in small teams or when rapid input is needed.

**Indirect upward communication** passes information through managerial layers.
Employees communicate with their immediate supervisors, who then relay relevant
information up the chain. While this method organizes reporting, it carries the
risk of filtering or distortion as messages pass through multiple levels.

> [!example] Examples of upward communication
> - Providing feedback on management decisions or strategies
> - Suggesting improvements to processes
> - Reporting obstacles or operational challenges
> - Giving project updates or progress reports
> - Sharing concerns about workplace conditions

Common communication channels:
- One-on-one meetings
- Feedback forms or surveys
- Team or project status reports
- Informal conversations or town halls

> [!success] Benefits
> - Helps leadership make decisions grounded in real experiences
> - Encourages employee engagement and psychological safety
> - Detects problems or opportunities early

> [!error] Drawbacks
> - Messages can be diluted or altered through layers
> - Employees may hesitate to speak up if the culture is not supportive
> - Requires active listening and follow-up from leadership to be effective

## Horizontal communication

![diagram representing horizontal communication flow](horizontal_communication.svg "Horizontal communication flow")

Also known as *peer-to-peer communication*, horizontal communication takes
place between colleagues at the same organizational level. It is essential for
coordination, collaboration, and knowledge sharing across teams or departments,
bypassing formal hierarchical channels.

This type of communication helps break down silos, align work across functions,
and foster a cooperative culture. It can be both informal, such as casual
discussions, or structured, through regular cross-functional meetings and
collaborative tools.

> [!example] Examples of horizontal communication
> - Coordinating tasks or schedules between colleagues
> - Sharing expertise or technical knowledge
> - Discussing problem-solving approaches or brainstorming ideas
> - Aligning deliverables across departments
> - Informal conversations that clarify processes or expectations

Common communication channels:
- Team meetings or workshops
- Instant messaging platforms or chat groups
- Collaborative project management tools
- Email threads among peers
- Informal conversations or coffee breaks

> [!success] Benefits
> - Enhances collaboration and teamwork
> - Reduces misunderstandings and duplicated work
> - Strengthens relationships and knowledge sharing

> [!error] Drawbacks
> - Can lead to information overload if not managed
> - Risk of misalignment if communication bypasses formal decision-making
> - May create informal power dynamics that influence outcomes

## Diagonal communication

![diagram representing diagonal communication flow](diagonal_communication.svg "Diagonal communication flow")

Diagonal communication occurs when messages flow across both levels and
departments, connecting individuals who are neither direct supervisors nor
peers. It is particularly useful for coordinating complex projects, solving
cross-functional problems, and speeding up decision-making in organizations
with multiple layers.

This type of communication breaks traditional silos by enabling collaboration
between people who otherwise might not interact directly. It often combines
formal channels, such as project reporting, with informal interactions, like
cross-department discussions.

> [!example] Examples of diagonal communication
> - A project manager coordinating with a team member from another department
> - Employees seeking guidance from a subject-matter expert outside their
>   direct reporting line
> - Managers exchanging information with non-reporting staff to address
>   operational issues

Common communication channels:
- Project management and collaboration tools
- Cross-department meetings or workshops
- Email or messaging across teams
- Informal discussions or networking sessions
- Cross-functional task forces

> [!success] Benefits
> - Accelerates problem-solving and decision-making
> - Enhances collaboration across departments and levels
> - Helps organizations respond more flexibly to challenges

> [!error] Drawbacks
> - Can create confusion if roles and responsibilities are unclear
> - Risks bypassing formal authority, potentially causing tension
> - Requires strong communication skills and clarity to be effective

## Hub communication

![diagram representing hub communication flow](hub_communication.svg "Hub communication flow")

Hub communication also known as "wheel communication" is a communication
pattern where all communication flows through a central figure or hub. This
individual acts as a focal point for disseminating and receiving information to
and from various members or departments within an organization. This type of
communication can streamline decision-making and ensure consistent messaging.

Hub communication is a centralized mode of interaction in which information
converges through one or more focal roles, functions, or systems that act as
coordination points. This model reflects network‑like structures where certain
actors serve as connectors or facilitators between otherwise distant parts of
the organization.

In this context, hubs do more than simply pass information; they shape, filter,
and orchestrate communication among participants. A well‑designed hub can
enhance clarity, reduce noise, and support complex coordination across teams or
departments. However, the effectiveness of hub communication relies on the
competence and situational awareness of the hub role itself.

James Coplien’s work on organizational patterns, particularly the _hub, spoke,_
_and rim_ configuration, provides useful insight into how hubs function in real
organizations. Through empirical studies of team communication networks,
Coplien and his collaborators identified hub roles as central connectors that
manage and balance the flow of information while reducing unnecessary direct
links between every pair of actors, creating a social network optimized for
coordination and productivity.


> [!example] Examples of hub communication
> - A project coordinator managing cross team updates
> - A product owner relaying priorities between engineering and stakeholders
> - Software architects coordinating teams on design implementation and
>   technical alignment without making final decisions
> - Staff or Principal engineers acting as natural hub points connecting
>   multiple teams and providing guidance

Common communication channels:
- Centralized dashboards or collaboration platforms
- Assigned liaison roles or coordinators
- Cross functional leadership committees
- Shared repositories of documentation and updates

> [!success] Benefits
> - Reduces the number of direct communication paths needed, simplifying
>   complexity
> - Helps ensure consistency and alignment in messages across groups
> - Facilitates coordination in large or distributed teams

> [!error] Drawbacks
> - Can become a bottleneck if the hub is overloaded or unclear in
>   responsibility
> - Risks silencing informal channels and reducing autonomy if
>   over‑centralized
> - Dependence on the hub’s skills and tools means weak hubs can harm
>   collaboration

## Synchronous and asynchronous communication flows

Once we understand the directions in which information can move, it becomes
crucial to consider **how** it moves. In other words, the **tempo and timing**
**of communication**, whether real-time or delayed, can greatly influence how
effectively teams collaborate and make decisions.

### Synchronous communication

Synchronous communication happens in real time. All participants are present
and engaged simultaneously, enabling immediate feedback and dynamic
interactions.

> [!example] Examples of synchronous communication
> - Team meetings or daily stand-ups
> - Video or phone calls
> - Instant messaging when everyone is online

> [!success] Benefits
> - Decisions are made quickly
> - Misunderstandings can be clarified immediately
> - Builds personal connection and team cohesion

> [!warning] Challenges
> - Requires strict discipline: meetings should have a clear agenda, defined
>   objectives, and necessary documents shared in advance
> - Participants must read and prepare beforehand, which often does not happen
>   in practice
> - Can be disruptive to focused work
> - Often leads to **unproductive meetings** when preparation or attention is
>   lacking
> - Not suitable for teams distributed across multiple time zones
> - **Difficult to scale**: adding more participants or larger teams often
>   reduces efficiency and interaction quality

Think of synchronous communication as a live conversation at a roundtable,
fast, responsive, and collaborative, although it can be potentially inefficient
without proper structure. **Generally speaking, unnecessary meetings should**
**be avoided**, and synchronous interactions should be reserved for topics that
truly require real-time engagement.

### Asynchronous Communication

Asynchronous communication occurs with a delay. Participants contribute at
different times, often using tools that preserve context and documentation.

> [!example] Examples of asynchronous communication
> - Emails and newsletters
> - Collaboration platforms (e.g., Slack threads, Confluence, shared documents)
> - Project management updates

> [!success] Benefits
> - Allows thoughtful, considered responses
> - Flexible for team members in different time zones
> - Reduces interruptions and supports focused work
> - **Supports scalability**: easily accommodates larger teams without reducing
>   efficiency

> [!warning] Challenges
> - Slower decision-making
> - Risk of misinterpretation without tone or nuance
> - Requires a strong culture and clear engagement: everything must be
>   documented and shared consistently
> - Generally more successful in **mature organizations** with established
>   norms and disciplined information practices

Asynchronous communication is like sending letters in a network of post
offices: the information travels steadily, reaches far, and is recorded. When
done well, it can outperform synchronous approaches, but only if the
organization has the maturity, discipline, and cultural commitment to make it
work.

### Finding the Right Balance

Successful organizations **blend synchronous and asynchronous flows**. Urgent
or highly collaborative topics often require synchronous communication, while
complex problem-solving, updates, and knowledge sharing thrive asynchronously.
Establishing clear norms, such as expected response times, documentation
standards, and company-wide engagement, ensures that both forms of
communication support efficiency, alignment, and employee well-being.

> [!tip] Key takeaway
> Synchronous meetings are powerful but risky. Without preparation, discipline,
> and focus, they often become unproductive. Asynchronous communication, when
> supported by a mature culture and clear documentation, is often the more
> efficient and sustainable choice.

## Mapping flows to structures

Understanding the different modes of communication within an organization is
more than an academic exercise. Each flow shapes how work is coordinated, how
information travels, and how teams interact. Recognizing the strengths and
limitations of each mode allows leaders and engineers to design processes that
are both efficient and resilient.

Communication patterns are closely tied to organizational design. The way 
information moves can either enable teams to collaborate effectively or create
friction, bottlenecks, and misalignment. Observing who communicates with whom,
and how, often reveals the informal networks that exist alongside formal
hierarchies.

In the next article, I will present the main frameworks and common ways teams
are split, providing a clear comparison to help you choose the team topology
that best fits your organization’s needs and goals.

The first step in applying this understanding is to map the communication flows
within your organization and clearly define through which channels each type of
information should be transmitted. This mapping should be documented and shared
with all teams to ensure everyone understands how information moves and who is
responsible for relaying it. The goal is to avoid the two extremes: teams
receiving too little information, leaving them uninformed, or too much
information, which overwhelms them and makes it difficult to filter what is
important.
