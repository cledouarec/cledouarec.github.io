We are increasingly asking our teams to reach a high level of performance:
managing complex projects, remaining effective under pressure, making quick
decisions, and maintaining strong engagement. In other words, we expect them to
behave like **high performers**.

And when we genuinely look at what it means to be a performer, we quickly
realize that the most demanding environments—such as high-level sports—never
rely solely on technical skills. Athletes benefit from optimal conditions:
**autonomy**, **targeted training**, **individualized support**, and above all,
**mental preparation**, which helps them manage pressure, stay clear-headed,
and transform stress into a lever rather than a barrier.

If we truly want to enable our employees to grow within this same logic of
sustainable performance, it becomes essential to integrate these principles
into our managerial practice. Autonomy alone is not enough; we also need to
provide a clear framework, regular feedback, and tailored support to help them
better understand how they react under pressure. This is where mental
preparation tools play a crucial role. When used effectively, they help reduce
performance anxiety, strengthen confidence, and create the right conditions for
everyone to give their best—without burning out.

But before diving into the core of the topic, a few quick reminders are
necessary.

## Mental preparation vs. psychology

Both approaches can sometimes use similar tools (breathing, visualization,
stress management), but their goals and frameworks are fundamentally different.

> [!question] What do you think the differences are?

**Mental preparation** is primarily focused on **performance**. It is aimed at
people who want to optimize their abilities in a specific context: sports,
music, public speaking, or any other field requiring efficiency and
consistency.

> [!note] This note applies specifically to France and may differ in other regions.
> It is not a regulated discipline: there is no state-recognized
> degree, and the relationship is centered on guidance toward a concrete goal.

**Psychology**, on the other hand, focuses on **well-being** and understanding
how a person functions. It addresses suffering, blockages, and potential
disorders, and requires long, state-recognized training (five years in France).
The framework is therapeutic, regulated, and protected.

In summary, mental preparation is oriented toward performance optimization,
while psychology focuses on mental health and quality of life.

As managers, even though we care about our teams’ well-being, it is neither our
role nor our area of expertise. Our actions are primarily focused on the
performance aspect.

## Performance anxiety: what is it?

Performance anxiety occurs when the fear of failure or stress related to an
expected performance becomes overwhelming. It can manifest as:
- Physiological overactivation (trembling, palpitations, sweating)
- Negative or intrusive thoughts (“What if I fail?”)
- Loss of concentration
- A tendency to avoid stressful situations, which can hinder achieving goals

## Causes of performance anxiety

> [!question] What do you think the causes are?

Performance anxiety typically arises when a situation has the following
characteristics:
- Perceived high stakes
- Mastery relative to the task
- Novelty
- Lack of control

## Psychological orientation

There are two main drivers, called psychological orientations, that influence
how a person approaches a task:
- **Task orientation**
- **Ego orientation**

Behaviors oriented toward **the task** versus **the ego** profoundly affect
how a person handles challenges, effort, and failure.

> [!question] What do you think are the characteristics of each orientation?

### Task orientation

A person focused on the task emphasizes **process and personal progress**. They
concentrate on:
- **Learning**: acquiring new skills or improving existing ones
- **Mastery**: solving problems and overcoming obstacles
- **Effort**: valuing the work done, regardless of the outcome
- **Self-comparison**: measuring success against their own progress

Characteristics:
- Lower performance anxiety, as failure is seen as a learning opportunity
- Greater resilience in the face of challenges
- Intrinsic motivation (satisfaction comes from completing the task itself)

> [!example]
> A musician practicing a difficult piece focuses on their personal progress,
> not on impressing a jury.

#### Advantages of task orientation

1. Strong intrinsic motivation
    - Focusing on learning and mastery provides lasting personal satisfaction,
      independent of external rewards.
    - Helps maintain long-term effort, even without immediate recognition.
2. Increased resilience to failure
    - Failure is seen as a learning opportunity rather than a personal threat.
    - A task-oriented person perseveres in adversity, valuing the process more
      than the immediate result.
3. Reduction in performance anxiety
    - By focusing on what can be controlled (effort, progress), the individual
      is less affected by external pressures or social comparisons.
4. Facilitated collaboration
    - A task-focused approach often values collective work and shared
      improvement, enhancing teamwork.
5. Continuous skill development
    - With mastery as the goal, a task-oriented person invests proactively and
      sustainably in learning.

#### Limits and risks of task orientation

1. Lack of social recognition
    - Focusing on personal improvement and process may cause a person to
      neglect visible or strategic results, limiting opportunities for
      promotion or external recognition.
2. Excessive perfectionism
    - Emphasis on mastery can sometimes lead to perfectionism, slowing progress
      or causing chronic dissatisfaction.
3. Difficulty adapting to competitive environments
    - In contexts where visible performance matters (e.g., sports competitions
      or professional presentations), exclusive task orientation may be seen as
      a lack of ambition.
4. Risk of overinvestment
    - Obsession with progress and learning can lead to burnout if personal
      limits are not respected.

### Ego orientation

A person focused on the ego emphasizes **external recognition** and **social**
**validation**. They aim to:
- **Prove themselves superior to others**
- **Avoid failure**, as it is perceived as a threat to self-esteem
- **Gain recognition** or approval from others

Characteristics:
- High performance anxiety, as failure is seen as a threat to identity or
  personal value
- A tendency to avoid challenges perceived as risky
- Extrinsic motivation (external rewards or fear of criticism)

> [!example]
> A student who studies only to outperform classmates and earn praise focuses
> more on their image than on learning.

#### Advantages of ego orientation

1. Motivation to excel
    - An ego-oriented person may strive to surpass themselves to prove their
      worth, which can strengthen determination.
    - This can be particularly useful in competitive environments where
      external recognition matters (e.g., high-level sports, professional
      competitions).
2. Boost to self-confidence
    - Achieving goals can foster strong self-esteem and encourage even higher
      performance.
3. Strategic performance management
    - In some cases, ego orientation helps prioritize effort on visible or
      strategic aspects of performance (e.g., shining during a key presentation
      to impress a jury).
4. Adaptation to social situations
    - This orientation can serve as a lever to meet social expectations and
      gain recognition, opening up opportunities (promotions, partnerships,
      etc.).

#### Limits and risks of ego orientation

1. Paralyzing fear of failure
    - When performance becomes a matter of identity, even small mistakes feel
      threatening. This fear can inhibit risk-taking, slow innovation, and lead
      to avoidance of challenging situations.
2. Dependence on external recognition
    - Prioritizing approval or validation from others reduces personal
      satisfaction derived from effort or learning. Intrinsic motivation
      weakens, making performance more fragile and volatile.
3. Excessive social comparison
    - Constantly measuring oneself against others can undermine self-esteem,
      especially when performance falls short. Result fluctuations then become
      emotionally costly, potentially causing frustration, anxiety, or
      discouragement.

## How to shift from an ego orientation to a task orientation?

1. Redefine success
    - Measure progress against yourself, not others
    - Value the learning process over the final outcome
2. Adopt a growth mindset
    - Believe that skills and talents can be developed through effort and
      perseverance
3. Practice self-compassion
    - Replace self-criticism with encouragement in case of failure or
      difficulty
4. Develop mindfulness
    - Focus on the present moment to prevent external judgments or comparisons
      from taking over your mind
5. Set mastery-oriented goals
   > [!example]
   > > I want to learn how to better organize my ideas
   >
   > instead of
   > > I must be the best in this exam

## Integrating both orientations: a balanced approach

The ideal is to combine the strengths of both orientations:
1. Combine ego and task
    - Ego can serve as the initial driver to take on ambitious challenges, but
      task orientation helps maintain sustained effort and enjoy the learning
      process
    > [!example]
    > Preparing a presentation aiming to impress (ego) while focusing on
    > quality and clarity of content (task)
2. Use ego to cultivate resilience
    - If failure occurs, it can be analyzed as an opportunity to grow rather
      than a threat to personal value
3. Draw inspiration from others without excessive comparison
    - Ego orientation can motivate benchmarking against role models, as long as
      it remains a source of inspiration rather than discouragemen

## Examples of integrating both orientations

### A sports competition

Task orientation:
- Focus on improving a technique or executing a movement correctly, without
  worrying about rankings
- Analyze past performances to identify areas for improvement

Ego orientation:
- Use competitive pressure to give your best, aiming to surpass yourself and
  impress spectators or judges

> [!tip] Balance
> During training, adopt a task-oriented approach (personal progress). During
> competition, use the environmental pressure to motivate yourself to excel.

### Important presentation in front of colleagues or executives

Task orientation:
- Focus on content quality and clarity of the message
- Carefully prepare key points, aiming to convey an idea or explain a concept
  in a clear and educational manner

Ego orientation:
- Pay attention to form: posture, tone of voice, and attractive visual aids to
  captivate the audience
- Treat the presentation as an opportunity to showcase your skills and stand
  out

> [!tip] Balance
> Prepare solid content (task) and use recognition from peers or supervisors as
> motivation to push yourself further (ego).

### Leading a team on a complex project

Task orientation:
- Emphasize collective progress and quality of work
- Set shared goals based on concrete and measurable results

Ego orientation:
- Highlight your role as a leader by showcasing your vision and impact
- Leverage positive feedback to reinforce your confidence and authority

> [!tip] Balance
> Encourage the team to improve by valuing their efforts (task), while using
> their success to strengthen your recognition as a leader (ego).

## Tips for finding balance

1. Self-assessment
    - Analyze your current behavior: Are you more often task-oriented or
      ego-oriented? Identify situations where one dominates excessively
2. Adapt to the context
    - Favor a task orientation for long-term projects or learning situations
    - Activate an ego orientation for moments where recognition or competition
      plays a key role
3. Shift from ego to task
    - If you feel overly focused on ego (e.g., fear of failure or dependence on
      validation), redirect your attention to concrete and controllable aspects
    > [!example]
    > What can I improve or learn here?
4. Shift from task to ego
    - If you are too task-oriented and feel a lack of motivation, remind
      yourself why success matters to you
    > [!example]
    > What impact will this success have on my career, social life, or
    > confidence?
5. Use visualization
    - Before a key event, visualize both:
        - Your personal success (ego)
        - Your progress and the effort you have put in (task)
6. Seek balanced feedback
    - Look for feedback that values both the quality of your work (task) and
      the impact you had on others (ego)

## How to link MBTI with task/ego orientation?

The MBTI can be a useful tool to better understand how we approach performance,
particularly by highlighting natural preferences that influence our orientation
toward task or ego. While it is neither the only model available nor an
infallible instrument, it provides a simple framework to explore our ways of
functioning, sources of motivation, and reactions to challenges. Used with
perspective, it can help identify useful tendencies for better
self-understanding—and, by extension, better support for others.

### MBTI and task orientation

MBTI personality types that are more **introverted (I)**, **thinking (T)**, or
**judging (J)** tend to favor a more task-oriented approach. These individuals
appreciate reflection, structure, and logic, seeking to improve their skills
and solve problems methodically and independently. Their main motivation is
often to achieve mastery in their domain, without necessarily seeking social
recognition.
> [!example]
> INTJ, ISTJ, INTP, ISFJ

### MBTI and ego orientation

MBTI types that are more **extraverted (E)**, **feeling (F)**, or
**perceiving (P)** may be more focused on social interactions and seeking
external validation. These individuals are often motivated by recognition,
visible success, and the social impact of their actions, aligning with an ego
orientation.
> [!example]
> ENFJ, ESFP, ENFP, ESFJ

## Two approaches in mental preparation techniques

Today, there are two approaches that can be considered opposite:
- control techniques
- acceptance techniques

The second has shown significantly better results, even though it is harder to
implement, so it is worth using both depending on the person and the situation.

### Control techniques

1. Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR)
    - Trains physical relaxation by alternating muscle tension and release to
      reduce bodily sensations associated with anxiety.
2. Diaphragmatic breathing
    - Focus on slow, deep breaths to calm the nervous system and reduce
      physiological signs of stress.
3. Cognitive restructuring
    - Identify irrational or negative thoughts ("I will fail") and replace them
      with more rational or positive ones ("I am well prepared, I will do my
      best").
4. Mental imagery
    - Visualizing a positive scenario where you successfully overcome a
      stressful situation can boost confidence and reduce anticipatory anxiety.
5. Planning and preparation
    - Practice methodically to feel more competent and reduce uncertainty. This
      includes repeating tasks or simulating anxiety-inducing situations.

### Acceptance techniques

1. Mindfulness
    - Practice mindfulness to observe your thoughts and emotions without
      judgment, staying anchored in the present moment.
2. Cognitive defusion (ACT techniques)
    - Learn to see anxious thoughts as simple mental events rather than truths.
      > [!example]
      > Note a stressful thought as
      > > I notice that I am thinking I might fail
      >
      > instead of
      > > I am going to fail.
3. Self-compassion
    - Practice responding to anxiety with kindness toward yourself, recognizing
      that imperfection is part of the human experience.
4. Radical acceptance
    - Acknowledge that some situations are beyond your control and fully accept
      the emotions they trigger, without resisting them.
5. Gradual exposure
    - Gradually face situations that provoke performance anxiety, without
      trying to avoid or control them.

## Examples of grounding techniques

Before concluding this article, here are some simple exercises to practice.
They require a little time, and it is best to start in a calm moment rather
than just before an anxiety-inducing situation, like a presentation.
It is normal to feel awkward at first or feel like it isn’t working, but the
key lies in repetition and trust in the process.

### 5-4-3-2-1 Technique

A classic exercise to engage the senses:
- Identify **5 things** you can **see** around you.
- Identify **4 things** you can **touch** or feel under your fingers.
- Identify **3 things** you can **hear**.
- Identify **2 things** you can **smell** (perfume, air, etc.).
- Identify **1 thing** you can **taste** (if possible).

This exercise refocuses your attention on the present moment.

### Box Breathing

This exercise helps stabilize your heart rate:
1. Inhale slowly for **4 seconds**.
2. Hold your breath for **4 seconds**.
3. Exhale slowly for **4 seconds**.
4. Hold your breath again for **4 seconds**.

Repeat the cycle several times to feel calm.

### Body Scan

The goal is to pay attention to sensations in your body:
1. Lie down or sit comfortably.
2. Focus on one part of the body at a time (feet, legs, abdomen, etc.).
3. Observe sensations (hot, cold, tension) without judgment.
4. Gradually move upward to your head.

### Guided Mindfulness Meditation

Focus your attention on your breathing, soft music, or a guided meditation
voice. The idea is to let thoughts pass like clouds without holding onto them.

### Grounding with a concrete object

Choose an object (a smooth stone, bracelet, pen) that you associate with a
sense of calm.
- Touch or hold this object when you feel stressed.
- Focus on its texture, temperature, weight, etc.
- Over time, this object will become a reminder of serenity.

> [!tip]
> Use a small, easily portable object that you can keep close at hand during
> important moments.

### Mindful Walking

During a walk:
- Feel the ground under your feet.
- Observe nature or your surroundings.
- Focus on the sensation of the air, sounds, and smells.

### Positive Affirmations

Choose a phrase that reassures you and repeat it quietly or in your mind.
> [!example]
> > I am capable.
>
> or
> > Everything will be fine.

Pair this affirmation with calm breathing.

### Expressive Writing

If your mind feels cluttered, take a few minutes to write down everything that
comes to mind, without censoring yourself. This can help release intrusive
thoughts.
