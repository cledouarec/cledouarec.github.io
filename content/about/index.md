Hello, my name is **Christophe**. I’m passionate about technology, embedded
systems, and software engineering.
After years spent working hands-on with low-level code — where every cycle
matters — I gradually moved toward **engineering and technical project**
**management**, with a strong conviction: you can lead without giving up your
deep love for tech.

My journey has taken me through embedded platforms, complex software
architectures, and products that require as much rigor as creativity. Today, I
support engineering teams by combining **strategic vision**, a
**collaboration-driven culture**, and **technical excellence**.

This blog allows me to share:
- thoughts on **management in a software engineering context** (and especially
  outside the usual “cloud-first” world);
- real-world experience from the field;
- ideas, methods, and sometimes constructive rants;
- a clear stance on a style of management that is **deeply rooted in**
  **technology, pragmatic, and human**.

No useless jargon here, no out-of-touch theory: just insights grounded in the
reality of software development, R&D, and technical leadership.

If you're an engineer, manager, tech lead, or simply curious about how to build
solid products and resilient teams, you're in the right place.

Thanks for being here — and happy reading!
